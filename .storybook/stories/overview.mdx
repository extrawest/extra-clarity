# Extra Clarity Docs

Extra Clarity is a library that contains [Angular components](#available-components) built on the top of the
[Clarity Design System](https://clarity.design), which we use in our internal projects in
[extrawest.com](https://extrawest.com).

Required deps:

- Angular 17.3.0 or later
- Clarity: 17.0.0 or later

The latest version with Angular 16 support is 0.17.2 (based on Clarity 15), and for Angular 15 - 0.15.22.

The library is under development. Any suggestions would be highly appreciated.

## Source Code

For the source code, either to report an issue, please refer to our
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/extrawest/extra-clarity).

## Documentation

This site is Storybook-based and contains the details about the [available components](#available-components)
and some live examples.

We are working on adding more information to it.

## Installation

The library is available as a [npm-package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@extrawest/extra-clarity).
You can add the package to your project with `npm install` or `yarn add`:

```shell
npm i @extrawest/extra-clarity
```

```shell
yarn add @extrawest/extra-clarity
```

To work with the library, you also need to add the Clarity packages:

```shell
npm i @cds/angular @clr/angular @clr/ui
```

```shell
yarn add @cds/angular @clr/angular @clr/ui
```

And then add the global Clarity styles to your `angular.json` config:

```json
"styles": [
  "node_modules/@clr/ui/clr-ui.min.css",
  ... any other styles
]
```

Please refer to the [Clarity docs](https://clarity.design/documentation/get-started)
for more details on 'Adding Clarity to an Angular project'.
