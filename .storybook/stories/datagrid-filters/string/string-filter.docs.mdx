## Quick Start

> **Standalone component**: yes

```typescript
import { EcStringFilterComponent } from '@extrawest/extra-clarity/datagrid-filters';
```

```html
<ec-string-filter />
```

```html
<clr-datagrid>
  ...
  <clr-dg-column>
    Station ID
    <clr-dg-filter>
      <ec-string-filter [propertyKey]="'stationId'" />
    </clr-dg-filter>
  </clr-dg-column>
  ...
</clr-datagrid>
```

## Example

In this example, the filter is attached to the 'Name' column:

<Canvas of={FilterStories.DocsExampleStory} />

## Stories

- [A filter within a client-driven datagrid](/story/components-datagrid-filters-string-filter--within-datagrid-story)
- [A filter in isolation](/story/components-datagrid-filters-string-filter--filter-itself-story)

## Description

This component is designed for filtering datagrids with a string value.
It utilizes the `ClrInput` component for editing the value.

<Markdown>{linksToClrDatagridDocs}</Markdown>

The component implements the `ClrDatagridFilterInterface` and can be used with both server-driven and client-driven
datagrids. By the way, the provided API allows to use the component outside of datagrids as well.

### Configuration

To configure the component you need to provide the following inputs:

1. `[serverDriven]` A boolean flag to indicate whether the filter and the parent datagrid are server-driven.
   If `true` (default) then the filtering algorithm must be processed externally, e.g. by a backend.
   Otherwise, filtering is processed by the filter's `accepts()` method.
2. `[propertyKey]`
   - For server-driven datagrids, it is a free-form identifier defined by a developer, that will be used
     as the `property` value in the output state to help identify the filter's state amidst another filters.
   - For client-driven datagrids it must be equal to the name of a field in the object passed to the `*clrDgItems`
     directive on `<clr-dg-row>` to filter by, i.e. to decide whether a row should be shown or not.

For client-driven datagrids you can also configure the filtering algorithm by setting the inputs
`[caseSensitive]` and `[fullMatch]`.

Please refer to the [API](#api) section below for more details about all the component's inputs.

### Default State

The default (inactive) filter's state is an empty string (nothing to filter).

### Output State

The component's output `(filterValueChanged)` emits an object with the actual filter state every time when the filter
gets a new valid value via the input field or programmatically.

The same state is also emitted by the `(clrDgRefresh)` output of the `<clr-datagrid>` parent component for any
non-default filter state.

The output state is an object with two fields: `property` as the name of a field to filter by, and `value` as the
actual string to filter with:

```typescript
// interface EcFilterState<string>
{
  property: string | number;
  value: string;
}
```

### Read/Write the State

The actual state of the filter can be read by the public getter `state` as `EcFilterState<string>`:

```html
...
<ec-string-filter #filterByName />
...
<span>{{ filterByName.state.value }}</span>
...
```

To check if the state is default, you can use the `isActive()` method, which returns `false` for the default state.

The value entered in the input field is accepted as the actual filter value only if it's valid.

There are also two ways to set a new value programmatically:

- put a value into the input `[value]`
- pass a value into the method `setValue(value: string)`

If the value provided to these methods is invalid, then the filter will be reset to the default state.

There are multiple inputs for setting up the validation, please refer to the **'Inputs/Validation'** subcategory in
the [API](#api) section below for more details.

The public method `resetToDefault()` resets the filter to the default state.

The component extends the abstract `EcDatagridFilter` class containing all the mentioned methods.
Therefore you can query the filter's instance via `@ViewChild(EcDatagridFilter)` and call the methods.

### Additional Info

The component uses `ClrPopoverToggleService` internally (as an optional injector provided by the `<clr-dg-column>` parent
component) to react to opening the filter: to focus the input field and reset an invalid entered value to the last
valid value. That's why we recommend to use the filter as nested in the `<clr-dg-column>` component (see code examples
on this page).
